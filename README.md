# Spotify Features Mix

The Spotify Features Mix is a playlist built using the Spotify Web API as it finds track features such as *danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, valence, and tempo.*

This will create a new playlist on your Spotify account with 50 songs similar to your top plays, with any optional seeds you provide.

**Heads up!** If you already own a playlist named "Spotify Features Mix" it will be overwritten.

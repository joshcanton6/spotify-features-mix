# Spotify Features Mix

The Spotify Features Mix is a playlist built using the Spotify Web API as it finds track personalized to your listening history. By analyzing various track features such as *danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, valence, and tempo,* every song in your playlist matches your musical preferences.
